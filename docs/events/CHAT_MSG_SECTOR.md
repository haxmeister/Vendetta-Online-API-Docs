## New observations — third collection batch (November 8–9, 2026 UTC)

**Stored examples:** 1. **Observed callback form(s):** `1:table`.

### Recorded examples

~~~text
signature=1:table
shape=redacted
event=CHAT_MSG_SECTOR
arguments=1
arg1 type=table
~~~

### Interpretation

Only callback argument counts and types were retained. Chat messages, names and table values were excluded at capture time.

**Occurrence-count caveat:** The watcher retains event counters across flushes. The counts reported with these examples are cumulative at the time of capture; they cannot be added to counts from earlier snapshots.
